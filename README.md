# Migrator


Script for realtime migration from one redis source to another in Golang. Inspired by RedisLabs https://github.com/RedisLabs/redis-migrate

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikefaraponov/migrator
go build
mv ./migrator /usr/local/bin/migrator
```

Google Wire https://github.com/google/wire used to simplify dependency management

Just specify ```$REDIS_SOURCE``` and ```$REDIS_DESTINATION``` and the deal will be done.

Requires replicaof or slaveof commands be available in your redis installation
